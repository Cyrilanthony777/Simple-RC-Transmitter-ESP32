### 📡 Simple RC Transmitter ESP32

A lightweight, easy-to-use RC (Radio Control) transmitter built on the ESP32 platform. This project enables wireless control of RC cars, drones, or robots using both **ESP-NOW** protocol and **CPPM (Combined PPM)** signal output. Ideal for DIY electronics, robotics, and custom transmitter setups.

**Features:**
- 📶 **ESP-NOW communication** (no Wi-Fi network required)  
- 🕹️ **Analog joystick & button input** support  
- 🔌 **CPPM signal output** for direct connection to RC receivers or flight controllers  
- 🔋 **Low-power, portable-friendly** design  
- ⚙️ **Simple configuration and modular code**  
- 🔧 Compatible with various ESP32 receiver and CPPM-based systems  

**Use Cases:**
- Custom remote controls for RC vehicles, planes, or drones  
- Robotics and mechatronics prototyping  
- Wireless data or control signal transmission  
- CPPM input for simulators, autopilots, or legacy RC systems
